            <h2>So what exactly <b>is</b> a pineapple?</h2>
            <p>A pineapple is a perennial plant, which means it grows for 2 or more years! It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family. which also includes succulants, Spanish Moss, and a plant called Tillandsia.
               Tillandsia is also called the "airplant" becuase it can grow on high up places, <i>like power lines</i>! Pineapple plants grow to be around 3 to 4 feet high when mature, with long and tough waxy leaves</p>

            <h2>Let's talk more about the fruit!</h2>
            <p>The pineapple fruit is formed from, believe it or not, a <b>single</b> flower. The flower grows with hundreds of sections, which individualy become pollinated. Afterwards they all combine together to create a single fruit!
            Often the number the sections in a pineapple form two interlocking layers, one 8 pollinated flowers or "berries" high and another 13 berries long. Fun fact, this stacking process is called a Fibonacci number! This is the reason why when you cut into a pineapple, there are tough fiberous sections inside. They were once <i>outside</i> the plant.</p>

            <p>At one time in the state of Hawaii, pineapples were an important enough crop that the farmers appealed to the state government to bring the main pollinator of wild pineapples to the island, hummingbirds! After consideration, the government banned the importation of hummingbirds to the island.</p>

   <h2>Where do pineapples come from?</h2>
   <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">The first instance of pineapple cultivation was discovered in South America, all the way back in 1200BC! These records came from the Mayans and Aztecs, from Mexico and Peru near modern day Brazil. It eventually made it's way into sourthern parts of North America, where in the 1400's it was documented as crop and key part of native american's diet.
      When Christopher Columbus brought back spoils from the New World to present to the rulers of Spain, he mistakenly claimed it was <i>pi√±a de Indes</i>, or pines of the Indians. In reality it was the other way around, South America brought the pineapple to India around 1550AD.

   <h2>Expensive Expensive Pineapple</h2>
   <p>When Europe gained an intrest in pineapple, only the elite had the resources to cultivate the tropical plant. It forced the construction of giant stoves in greenhouses to keep the plants warm. In addition it had not been discovered that early harvesting of the flower would result in smaller and larger amounts of crop.
      So while the fruits would be large, they would take much longer to grow. This lead to the price tag of pineapples around the 1700's to be almost 5000&pound; in modern conversian rates! Shops opened not selling pineapples to eat, but to <i>rent</i>. They would be placed as dinner centerpieces until the fruit was rancid and then thrown away.
      Others who wanted to enjoy similar setpieces without the pricetag would insted make pineapple stand scuptures out of ceramics. Even then many of these stands were designed to put fruit in the top. Some had slots for real pineapples to be put in the center, with space to put other foods around it.

   <p>A noteworthy fued began between aristocrats who could afford to grow pineapples in heated greenhouses. To the point that the style of garden built in this manner became "Pineries" Eventually a man who was well known for these rivalries named John Murray, an Earl of a place in Scotland called Dunmore, modeled his <b>entire garden</b>
   after a pineapple! This building, named the Dunmore pineapple, stands still to this day and is ironicly avalible to rent for weddings and gatherings.</p>

   <h2>The Pineapple Bites Back</h2>
   <p>Pineapples can be eaten raw or cooked, but have you ever noticed your mouth feeling strange after eating too much? This is because pineapples contain an enzyme called Bromelain, which is actually in the entire plant, not just the fruit. Bromelain is proteolytic, which means it breaks down proteins into more simple forms like ameno acids.
      That's right, the pineapple eats <b>YOU</b> while you eat it. Bromelain hasn't stopped many people from enjoying pineapple in all sorts of dishes, altough it does interfere with the setting of gelatin based desserts. Some global favorites include fruit salads, pineapple upsidedown cake, and the infamous hawaiian pizza. Here's one of my own favorite recipes with pineapple!   </p>
      <h3 id="recipeTitle">Pineapple marinaded Pork chops</h3>
      <p>Here's what you need</p>
   </b>
       <ol id="recipe">
         <li>1 8 ounce can of pineapple rings, save the juice when you open the can</li>
         <li>One fourth cup of brown sugar</li>
         <li>One fourth cup soy sauce</li>
         <li>Two tablespoons of garlic powder</li>
         <li>Two teaspoons black pepper</li>
         <li>Two teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>
         <li>4 standard chops</li>
         <li>A gallen sized sealable plastic bag</li>
       </ol>
      </b>
      <p>To start, take everything except the pork chops and the pineapple rings and mix inside the plastic bag, making sure to have an even mix. You might need to pinch the bag a bit to get the sugar to dissolve</p>
      </b>
      <p>Place the chops inside the bag and mix. Squeeze out the air by leaving a corner open and pressing down gently. Leave inside the fridge to marinade overnight. Place the rings in the fridge too.</p>
   </b>
      <p>Remove the chops and set aside the excess marinade.If you want to use a grill, preheat to medium heat and oil the grate. You want about 5-7 minutes on each side. Brush extra marniade between flipping. If you can't use a grill, you can sear the chops in a pan on high heat and broil in an oven for 7-10 mins, flipping and brushing marniade on the chops halfway through.</p>  
   </b>
      <p>The pineapple rings will only take a few minutes on the grill, just cook until you get grill marks on each side. If you are using an oven, just add the rings to an oven pan and place at the same time as pork chops as they cook. </p> 
      </b>
      <p>You can add the pineapple to the side or on top!</p>
