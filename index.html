            <h2>So what exactly <b>is</b> a pineapple?</h2>
            <p>A pineapple is a perennial plant, which means it grows for 2 or more years! It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family. which also includes succulants, Spanish Moss, and a plant called Tillandsia.
               Tillandsia is also called the "airplant" becuase it can grow on high up places, <i>like power lines</i>! Pineapple plants grow to be around 3 to 4 feet high when mature, with long and tough waxy leaves</p>

            <h2>Let's talk more about the fruit!</h2>
            <p>The pineapple fruit is formed from, believe it or not, a <b>single</b> flower. The flower grows with hundreds of sections, which individualy become pollinated. Afterwards they all combine together to create a single fruit!
            Often the number the sections in a pineapple form two interlocking layers, one 8 pollinated flowers or "berries" high and another 13 berries long. Fun fact, this stacking process is called a Fibonacci number! This is the reason why when you cut into a pineapple, there are tough fiberous sections inside. They were once <i>outside</i> the plant.</p>

            <p>At one time in the state of Hawaii, pineapples were an important enough crop that the farmers appealed to the state government to bring the main pollinator of wild pineapples to the island, hummingbirds! After consideration, the government banned the importation of hummingbirds to the island.</p>

   <h2>Where do pineapples come from?</h2>
   <p>The first instance of pineapple cultivation was discovered in South America, all the way back in 1200BC! These records came from the Mayans and Aztecs, from Mexico and Peru near modern day Brazil. It eventually made it's way into sourthern parts of North America, where in the 1400's it was documented as crop and key part of native american's diet.
      When Christopher Columbus brought back spoils from the New World to present to the rulers of Spain, he mistakenly claimed it was <i>pi√±a de Indes</i>, or pines of the Indians. In reality it was the other way around, South America brought the pineapple to India around 1550AD.

   <h2>Expensive Expensive Pineapple</h2>
   <p>When Europe gained an intrest in pineapple, only the elite had the resources to cultivate the tropical plant. It forced the construction of giant stoves in greenhouses to keep the plants warm. In addition it had not been discovered that early harvesting of the flower would result in smaller and larger amounts of crop.
      So while the fruits would be large, they would take much longer to grow. This lead to the price tag of pineapples around the 1700's to be almost 5000&pound; in modern conversian rates! Shops opened not selling pineapples to eat, but to <i>rent</i>. They would be placed as dinner centerpieces until the fruit was rancid and then thrown away.
      Others who wanted to enjoy similar setpieces without the pricetag would insted make pineapple stand scuptures out of ceramics. Even then many of these stands were designed to put fruit in the top. Some had slots for real pineapples to be put in the center, with space to put other foods around it.

   <p>A noteworthy fued began between aristocrats who could afford to grow pineapples in heated greenhouses. To the point that the style of garden built in this manner became "Pineries" Eventually a man who was well known for these rivalries named John Murray, an Earl of a place in Scotland called Dunmore, modeled his <b>entire garden</b>
   after a pineapple! This building, named the Dunmore pineapple, stands still to this day and is ironicly avalible to rent for weddings and gatherings.</p>
